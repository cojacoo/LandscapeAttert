# Soil-landscape Analysis Example
## Joint utilisation of GRASS and Python to analyse spatial patterns at the Attert basin

This is simply a copy of two workfiles I used for my phd. One loads and analyses maps from GRASS GIS to derive spatial co-occurrence plots. The second calculates the clear sky radiation for several locations in the experimental basin.

Notice that jupyter needs to be started from your GRASS command line to work.
